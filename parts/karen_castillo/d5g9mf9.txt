***********************************************************************

&nbsp;



>     Goodnight, to every little hour that you sleep tight

>     May it hold you through the winter of a long night

>     And keep you from the loneliness of yourself

>     Heart strung is your heart frayed and empty

>     Cause it's hard luck, when no one understands your love

>     It's unsung, and I say

>     Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day

>     Goodnight, always, to all thats pure that's in your heart 

&nbsp;

>     Goodnight, may your dreams be so happy and your

>     Head lite with the wishes of a sandman and a night light

>     Be careful not to let the bedbugs sleep tight nestled in your covers

>     The sun shines but I don't

>     A silver rain will wash away

>     And you can't tell, it's just as well

>     Goodnight, my love, to every hour in every day

>     Goodnight, always, to all that's pure that's in your heart
